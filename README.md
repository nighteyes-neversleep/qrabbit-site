# Quantum Rabbithole - Kiosk Template

This repository contains a Vite + React + TypeScript + Tailwind starter used as a kiosk/template for the Quantum Rabbithole project.

Getting started:

1. Install dependencies

   npm install

2. Start dev server

   npm run dev

3. Build

   npm run build

Notes:
- Entrypoint moved to src/main.tsx and App is at src/App.tsx so TypeScript project references (tsconfig.app.json) will include the app files.
- Placeholder pages were added under src/pages so the router loads without errors.
